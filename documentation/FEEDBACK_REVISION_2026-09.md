## Feedback → implementation

| Feedback | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Profile images show too much of the hands/wrist area | Portrait frames now use tighter square crops and higher focal positions. Source images are untouched. |
| Selected Work has filters/categories without concrete examples | Empty categories were removed. Every visible category now maps to an actual case study. |
| Skills need proof, not just labels | Expertise now bridges directly to Selected Work, and case studies expose an **Evidence & Resources** section. |
| Experience entries are inconsistent or missing descriptions | Career chronology was rebuilt from the updated CV. Each published role has a factual mandate and outcomes where the source provides them. |
| Copy uses too many commas and dashes | Core hero, profile, career and case-study copy was rewritten into shorter, more direct sentences. |
| Expertise content is squeezed to the left on mobile | The expertise grid now explicitly places title and body content in a usable second column on small screens, with a three-column editorial layout on desktop. |
| Add external links for articles/newsletters | A reusable external-resource renderer was added. The Full Shangwe Barrick/UDOM article and the Mzumbe Career Fair Instagram post are now published as supporting resources. |
| Add the latest event | **The Men's Circle**, 17 Sep 2026, is featured on Speaking and added to the speaking gallery. |
| Use the updated CV | Career content, education, training, languages and current assignment follow the consultant CV dated 04/09/2026. The owner-supplied consultant CV is now served directly from the stable public CV path. |

## Content architecture changes

### Current professional positioning

The site now positions Vicent around four connected areas:

1. Management consulting
2. Research and evaluation
3. Strategic partnerships
4. Organizational and programme leadership

This is reflected consistently across the hero, profile, expertise, metadata and current-role proof.

### Evidence-first case studies

The case-study schema now supports:

- overview,
- challenge,
- objectives,
- role,
- strategy,
- execution,
- evidence/resources,
- outcomes,
- related case studies.

This makes professional claims inspectable rather than leaving them as skill labels.

### External resources

`VM.data.externalResources` contains the verified Full Shangwe article and Mzumbe Career Fair Instagram post. The component renders only real public URLs.

## Responsive and visual changes

- Portrait crops prioritize face and upper torso. Primary profile portraits now use a tighter 5:4 frame so wrist accessories such as bracelets or watches remain outside the visible crop.
- Expertise layout no longer collapses content against the left edge.
- Resource rows use large, keyboard-focusable targets.
- Featured event layout collapses cleanly to one column on smaller screens.
- No existing source portrait is destructively edited.

## New and updated assets

- `assets/cv/vicent-manila-cv.pdf` — final owner-supplied consultant CV
- `assets/images/Vince/web/events/mens-circle-2026/mens-circle-vicent-manila-host.jpg`

Only Vicent Manila's host artwork is published for The Men's Circle. Guest, group and generic cover artwork were removed from the portfolio implementation.

## Source integrity

See:

- [CONTENT_VERIFICATION.md](./CONTENT_VERIFICATION.md)
- [CONTENT_NEEDS_VERIFICATION.md](./CONTENT_NEEDS_VERIFICATION.md)

The updated consultant CV now supersedes older source conflicts for career facts.

- External links use safe new-tab attributes.
- The Vicent Manila Men's Circle host artwork resolves from the structured event directory.
- The public CV resolves from `assets/cv/vicent-manila-cv.pdf`.
